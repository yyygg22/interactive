  	<p><b>Purchase your videos in a Blu-ray format.</b> DVD stands for Digital Versatile/Video Disc. Videos in this format can be played in a DVD player, or on most newer computers via the DVD-ROM drive.
Purchase DVD videos at retail stores such as Best Buy or Walmart.
Use online sources like the aforementioned brands' websites, or at Amazon.com in order to purchase DVD videos.
Hit up your local video store and see what previously-released videos they have for sale. Purchasing a previously-watched copy can generally come at a greater cost savings than purchasing the video new from a traditional retailer.
Watch garage sales for even more videos to add to your collection. With the move to electronic file and Blu-ray players, many families are selling their old DVDs for a fraction of what you would pay had you purchased them from a retailer.</p>

  	<p>Not only can you watch them on your computer, but most phones and tablet devices support video content as well.
Buy your movies at http://www.apple.com/itunes/whats-on/#movies, and start watching them in minutes. Movies purchased through iTunes can be watched via your computer, your television using Apple TV, your iPod touch, iPad or iPhone.
Both the Amazon.com and Best Buy websites also have videos that you can purchase and download to watch anytime.</p>

  	<p><b>Consider the cost. </b> There is usually a charge for the service, regardless of whether payment is actually stopped or not. [2] This varies from bank to bank. Depending upon your relationship with the financial institution, fees may not be required or will be forgiven. If you know there will be a fee, you may not want to place a stop payment because of the extra cost. If a check is worth less than the amount of the fee, let the payment go through. If you receive an overdraft fee, it is about the same price as a stop payment fee at most banks.Be aware that overdraft fees can be incurred again and again if the money is not replaced.[3]
